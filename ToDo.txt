_ Implement 4.1 fully
	V If the maximum fitness of a species did not improve (+0.5) in 15 generations, 
		the networks in the stagnant species were not allowed to reproduce. (Unless species was in top 2)

	V In each generation with more than five networks, 
		the top NN was copied into the next generation unchanged.
	_ In each generation, 25% of offspring resulted from mutation without crossover. 
	_ The interspecies mating rate was 0.001. 

	V 0.03 chance of adding a new node and 0.05 chance of adding a new link.
	V 0.80 chance of a genome having its connection weights mutated, 
	X	in which case each weight had a 0.90 chance of being uniformly perturbed and 
		a 0.10 chance of being assigned a new random value.
	_ 0.75 chance of disabling an inherited gene if it was disabled in either parent.

_ Comparable To Paper Results
	_ No failure in 100 runs
	_ ~32 generations to finish
	_ 2.5 nodes and 7.5 connections
